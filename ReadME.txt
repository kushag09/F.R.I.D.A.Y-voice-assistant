			===========================	F.R.I.D.A.Y	===========================


F.R.I.D.A.Y is your new personal voice-assistant. This project is inspired by JARVIS in the Iron Man franchise. This project
is still in its development phase. The TTS engine is used by overriding the Cortana tts voice from windows 10. You will have
to launch 2 registry files in order to do this which are included in the package.

The voice-assistant uses python programming language as its core. Python version above 3.5 is recommended to run this project 
smoothly. At this time only Windows 10 is supported. Support ops for Linux and Android are still under active development.
F.R.I.D.A.Y uses python libraries for its functioning. You may need to download and install the required libraries if you
don't have them installed on your computer using the "pip install" command from command prompt. Its developed on Python 3.8.5
version (to be specific). If you experience any problems regarding the functionality, please upgrade your python version to
the latest. This project uses Google's speech-recognition API for taking user commands. You will have to say the default 
hotword "Friday" to activate the assistant (You can change it later from the main python file. Say the commands when you hear 
the beep sound. You can compile this code later using the "pyinstaller" module from the official python module support 
website (www.pypi.org) to create an active EXE installer for your system. Everythign from A-Z requires an active internet 
connection.


As this project is completely open-source, any recommendations and fork updates are requested.
You can change the name of the project (Make sure you change it everywhere including hotword, main file and other referenced
areas.

The upcoming versions of this program will be published on the official GitHub channel (joelalbert).
